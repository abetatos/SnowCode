# SnowCode

This code was used in order to train the model used for my Master's degree disseration ["How to obtain high resolution snow height maps with geospatial data? A deep learning approach"](https://github.com/abetatos/SnowCode/files/13437281/Dissertation.pdf)

It also contains notebooks used for preprocessing and analisys of results using some of the most known libraries of the Geospatial field, namely: GDAL, Rasterio, Geopandas, whiteboxtools RichDEM
